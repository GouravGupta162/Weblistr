          <p>We do not make direct suggestions but we guide you through the process. First we provide you with a list of websites and apps suitable to your needs. Then we give you all the information you need about an online business such as what products/services they provide, their contact details, location, delivery time etc. Users on our platform rate and review websites so that you can make an informed decision easily.</p>
          <span>The website/app/startup I use is not there on Weblistrs.  Can I add it?</span>
          <p>Yes absolutely. Infact we would love for you to tell us about newer online businesses. Whether you are an online business owner or their customer, feel free to list any new startup with us. You just have fill  tiny little form (list a business).

          <p>Yes you can. Just remember to register with us as a business owner if you want to use our business services.</p>
          <p>Please don’t write reviews for your own business. Please don’t even invite your friends/family to write reviews. Don’t pay people to write reviews. What is the point?</p>
          <span>What is a Weblist? How can I create one? </span>
          <p>You can bookmark start-ups and companies websiteswhose services you either use or would like to use in the future. This curated list of websites and apps becomes your own Weblist.  You can view it on your profile page, update is as frequently as you like and even share it with your friends.</p>
          <span>What is the featured list and how does it work?</span>

We feature new start-ups in order to spread the word about them. Startup with a spark and out-of-the-box ideas and concepts make it this list.</p>
          <span>In what order do the websites appear in the list? </span>
          <p>The order in which the websites appear in a particular category is based on chronology. The ones appearing on top are the latest entrants in that category. The order has nothing to do with preference, ratings, reviews etc.</p>
          <h4>All About Ratings and Reviews:</h4>
          <span>How does rating work?</span>
          <p>A customer can rate a website between 1 -5 stars, 5 being the best.  Overall ratings for each online business is calculated on a simple average basis. Overall ratings appear at the top of each destination page, and individual ratings are shown next to each review. The distribution is shown in the profile page of each website.  If you wish to remove/edit a rating or review, you can email us and based on our discretion, we may remove/edit the review.</p>
          <p>Customers can rate and review a particular website only 2 twice a week, and cannot write more than 10 reviews a day.</p>

          <span>My website is already listed on Weblistrs. Do I still need to create an account?</span>
          <p>A listing doesn’t entitle you to any of our above mentionedservices directly. You still need to create an account and link your business to it to be able to edit information, respond to reviews etc.</p>
          <span>My business offers products/services in more than one category. What do I do?</span>
          <p>That’s great. Your business will be listed in all the categories you are present in. While listing you need to select multiple categories. However, the rating across categories will be a single one. We are trying to segregate it though. Just give us some time.</p>
          <span>Some of the information about my startup/company is incorrect or incomplete. How do I edit/update it?</span>

          <p>To be a part of this list, contact us at: <a href="#">sales@Weblistr.com</a> or call us. </p>
          <span>I listed my website but it is not appearing in the category. What should I do?</span>
          <p>When you list a startup/company, it goes through a verification process that takes typically a day. If your website still doesn’t appear on the portal, it could be because of incorrect information or duplicate irrelevant or inappropriate site content.</p>
